# Cultural Heritage Collections @ UiB-UB

This is a monorepo containing the web exhibitions published by UiB-UB.

## What's inside?

This Turborepo uses [npm](https://npmjs.com) as a packages manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps

- `api-ub`: apis for the cultural heritage collections at the University of Bergen Library, a [Next.js v13](https://beta.nextjs.org) app
- `exh-nt`: the exhibition _Neverending and temporary_, a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app

### Packages

- ui: core React components
- tsconfig: shared tsconfig.jsons used throughout the monorepo
- eslint-preset-custom: ESLint preset

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

## Setup

```sh
git clone ...
cd choc-monorepo
```

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
yarn build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
yarn dev
```

### Useful commands

Examples here use `yarn`, but this is easy to fudge up.

* npm install <package> â€“ Add package to root (mainly for devDependencies)
* npm install <package> --workspace=<workspace>
* npm uninstall <package> --workspace=<workspace>
* npm update <package> --workspace=<workspace>
* npm install
* npm run build - Build all packages and apps
* npm run dev - Develop all packages and apps
* npm run lint - Lint all packages
* npm run changeset - Generate a changeset
* npm run clean - Clean up all node_modules and dist folders (runs each package's clean script)

### Changesets

```sh
# Create feature branch
# Commit change(s)
# Merge
yarn changeset
# Answer the questions
git add . && git commit -m "<message>"
git push
# New PR should have been created by Github Action
git fetch && git reset --hard origin/main
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.org/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd chc-monorepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
